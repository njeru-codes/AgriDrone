# AgriDrone
AgriDrone is a machine learning-based plant disease detection system that uses a drone-mounted camera to capture images of crops and analyze them for signs of disease. The project aims to improve crop yields by enabling farmers to detect diseases early and take appropriate measures to prevent their spread.
